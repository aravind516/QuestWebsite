								Andre Camel worked with Shuichi Akai before when he was an agent in the Black Organization.<br>
								Camel was involved in the plan to capture Gin two years ago, but he gave away the plan of the FBI<br>
								when he saw a member of the organization disguised as an old man.<br>
								Because of this, Shuichi's identity became known to the Organization.<br>
								However, Shuichi does not seem to bear a grudge against Camel but worked together well.
